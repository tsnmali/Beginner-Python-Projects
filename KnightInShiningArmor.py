You disembark from the boat and begin walking. After a few hours, you come across a ravine that you have no choice but to descend.

You steadily climb your way down, careful not to move any loose rocks in fear of them tumbling down on top of you.

Wary, you look for an alternative and see a long, winding dirt path that leads to the exit of the ravine. However, the path is riddled with earth vents that appear to be inactive.

You try to avoid any confrontation by inching your way around the animal as quietly as possible. Sweat beads down your face from fear and anxiety.
The cave exit is just up ahead, so you begin to run. This was a terrible mistake, as your foot kicks a bone, making a loud rattling sound that echoes through the cave.
The Charatex wakes up with deadly intent and begins chasing you at full speed. You run and keep running. Thankfully, you make it out of the cave in one piece with the Charatex far behind you.

After days of traveling, you finally reach the castle. Claw marks and blackened stone from fire riddle the castle walls. You take cautious steps forward. 
The entrance is blocked by an aged and heavy wooden door. You push the door open with all your might, causing a loud creak. 
Behind the door is nothing but a long, dark hallway and wax candles held up by wall sconces, dimly lit by weak flames. You enter, and the door closes with a loud thud.

At the end of the hall is another large door. You reach the door and slowly open it. You enter and find the princess locked inside a golden cage. 
She lifts her head and gazes upon you with somber eyes. You quickly make your way toward her. You notice a long metal chain attached to the top of the cage connected to a lever on the ground.
As you are about to introduce yourself and turn the lever, the princess viciously shakes her head and points to her ear. You realize she wishes you to stay silent and listen.
As you do, you hear heavy footsteps coming from the hallway you just exited. As they near, the ground begins to shake, and the princess begins to shed tears.
Quickly, you look for a place to hide and see steps that lead to a balcony. You run up the steps and hide. Just as your head begins to lower, the heavy door slams open, and the dragon enters with fury.

It circles the princess, flicking its tongue to taste the air. Its long tail begins to sway violently, indicating agitation. Its head turns to the princess, back facing toward you, and lets out a vicious roar that rattles the princess's cage.
Realizing this is your only chance, you jump from the balcony and land on the dragon's neck.

After a few minutes of struggle, you manage to defeat the dragon and rescue the princess from her prison.
